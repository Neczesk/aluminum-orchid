The Black Robes are those who explore both the mundane and the spiritual worlds. They build mighty ships and explore the land around the city, and conduct strange rituals to explore the realm of the spirits in the night. While theyâ€™re at it, they move product and resources around the city to where they need to be. The Guilds use magical processes to fashion the finest gear, and the Laborers use the Black Robes to find new lands to tame and claim. The White Robes and the Black Robes collaborate to understand the magical and natural sides of the world around the City.
