The Guilds are a faction based around industry and production. They will primarily be responsible for implementing the technology that the White Robes discover, using the resources produced by the Laborers and brought to them by the Black Robes. The White Robes in turn require the instruments and tools produced by the Guilds, the Laborers use tools and machinery produced by the Guilds, and Black Robes travel the world and explore the spirits using tools made by the Guilds.
