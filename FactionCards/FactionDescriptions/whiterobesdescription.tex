The White Robes are the scholars of the material world. A myriad of different jobs that all have only a few things in common; in particular, a need for learning and writing. Without the White Robes, the City would stagnate in its technology, have no sense of history, and be a hopelessly disorganized mess. The Laborers and Guilds provide the White Robes with food and machinery, while the Black Robes bring them the raw information needed to do their work. In exchange the White Robes bring history, expertise, and advancement.
