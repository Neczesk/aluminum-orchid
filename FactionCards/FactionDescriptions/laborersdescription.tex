The Laborers are those who bring materials out of the earth itself so that the City can survive. It is difficult, dangerous, and often thankless work, which is why they have organized themselves as a Faction to get the credit they deserve. The Laborers produce the steel for the Guilds, the wood and wax for the Black Robes, and the copper and silicon for the White Robes. In turn, the Guilds give the Laborers tools, the White Robes give them expertise, and the Black Robes give them purpose.
