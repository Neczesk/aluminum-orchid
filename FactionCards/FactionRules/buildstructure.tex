Choose one of your unlocked Structure Cards. Pay one Development Token, then pay the resource cost listed on the Structure Card. If you are able to pay both the resource cost and the Development Token, place an instance of that Structure on any Tile you choose as long as the Tile does not already have a Structure, the Tile is In Supply, and the Tile is In Control. If the Structure Card has any additional effects that occur when the Structure is built, they occur now.
