The White Robes player decides which of the other factions gets the credit for resolving a crisis or milestone. On a turn in which a Crisis or Milestone is resolved, the White Robes player spends a Development Token. The level of the Crisis or Milestone is added to that Player’s Reputation; half of that is then added to the White Robes’ Player’s Reputation.
