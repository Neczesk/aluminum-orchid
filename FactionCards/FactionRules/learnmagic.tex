The Magic Web works generally the same way as the Tech Web that the White Robes use. However instead of material technologies, the Black Robes player focuses on the secrets of magic and the even more mysterious ways of the human mind and the metaphysical nature of the world. To research on the Magic Web, the Black Robes player spends a Development Token to activate the correct Institution, then pays any resources listed as a cost on the Magic Technology Card. Unlike the White Robes, each Magic Institution can be activated multiple times in one year; in exchange, most Magic Technologies have rapidly increasing resource costs as you go further along one of the Nodes. Once a Magic Technology is researched, it takes immediate effect. Some will have additional effects listed on the card; these also take effect as soon as the technology takes effect.
