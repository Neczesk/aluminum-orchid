Choose one of the unlocked Institution Cards. Each Institution Card requires a Development Token from at least two different, specific Factions. One of the required factions on the card must be yours. Then, if the other players who will need to contribute a Development Token agree to do so, then pay those Development Tokens immediately. Then, you and the players who contributed Development Tokens may also contribute resources to the resource cost listed on the Institution card. If the cost is completely paid, then add the Institution to the City Sheet. If the Institution has any additional effects that occur when created, these happen now.
