The Tech Web is mostly explained in its own chapter; however, in general, to research a technology the White Robe player must spend a Development token to activate the correct Institution (each research Institution has a list of technologies that are researched there), then pay any resources listed as a cost on the Technology Card. Each Institution may only be activated once in a given generation, so to maximize technological advancement it is important to build many of them. Once a Technology is researched, it takes immediate effect. Some technologies have additional effects listed on the card; these happen as soon as the technology takes effect.
